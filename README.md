# WI-Template

## About
The provided template is based on the LNCS template from Springer and adapted for usage for the WI conference proceedings.

## Usage
### Authors
Author names are specified by `\author{}`. If there are multiple authors, use `\and` to separate them, e.g.:

```latex
\author{First Author \and
Second Author \and
Third Author}
```

### Affiliations
Institutions are specified by `\institute{}`. Use `\and` to separate multiple institutions (see Authors).
You can use `\email{}` and `\url{}` within `\institute{}` to specify e-mail addresses and links to the respective institutions.

To map the institutions to the authors, use `\inst{<number>}` after the corresponding author names. 
`<number>`refers to the "rank" of the elements, which are listed within `\institute{}`.
